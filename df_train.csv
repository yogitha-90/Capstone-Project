When first approaching the property I started to understand why the owner gave it its name, ""Palazzo delle Lucce"" or ""Palace of Light"". The property is ideal for someone looking for something representative with ample gardens and panoramic views of the coast. The Palazzo has been well designed for the entertaining of guests and of its owners: A cinema for up to 10 guests, a library, and a wellness area with gymnasium and Turkish bath for 8 people make this a country retreat which is hard to get away from! Its location in La Zagaleta is certainly important in that the owner of this property can enjoy golf, tennis, hiking and riding. For those looking for a secure environment, la Zagaleta has only 2 gated entrances to the estate both of which have 24 hour strict security. The administration at the estate also provides red carpet services for the property owners.
  Villa for sale in La Zagaleta, Benahavis Quality and luxury has driven the building of this spectacular mansion situated in Europe’s most exclusive estate La Zagaleta, offering two golf courses, a private equestrian club, and 24-hour security.  Enjoying unobstructed views of the coast, the sea and the surrounding hills and woods, the south facing residence was designed by a well known leading architect, using only the most precious materials for its construction: fine handmade blown crystal glass by Marieux and ceiling mouldings, different kinds of high quality marble such as Carrara, Onyx, Red Alicante, Brown Emperador and Pink Portuguese.  The oak panelled library can store 2500 volumes, and the carpeted home-cinema equipped according to latest technical standards seats 10 people. The spacious kitchen with a dumb waiter and a fireplace is a culinary delight. Formal dining and entertaining rooms complement equally large bedrooms and a spa with gymnasium and changing rooms. Staff self-contained accommodation in basement.  No expense has been spared in creating what is truly one of the most spectacular homes in the area.

My mother, Diana, tells me that she visited the house for the first time some years ago when it belonged to its previous owners and she thought that its Mediterranean-style architecture, with soft rooflines and large windows was timeless. She always says that good architecture withstands the test of time. And this is what I have seen recently while visiting this house. Spacious and bright rooms, covered and sheltered terraces that are an extension of the living and dining areas of the house. The chill-out thatched roof gazebo next to the paddle court, and the large swimming pool and Jacuzzi surrounded by a garden with tall mature trees, are the delight of both the family and their visitors as well as guests.
The entrance to the house through an elegant palm tree lined driveway is the announcement of the pleasure one feels upon entering the hall of the house and getting a glimpse of the terraces, the garden and swimming pool in the background. The house is ideal for families with young children or elderly people as it is all laid out on one floor. This also adds to its privacy and integration with the surrounding gardens.

Architect Milet has done a great job. He has created an amazing contemporary style villa with skylight windows and interior patios that bring light to every corner of the house whilst he has remained faithful to the original architecture of the first house built on this site. Back in the 80's I visited the house that was only one storey high and had also the curved line on the southern façade that Milet has so wonderfully recreated. A unique site for this wonderful villa.  Villa for sale in Los Monteros, Marbella East Vary rarely does a property like this one come on the market. Not only because of its modernist design but mostly because of its unique front line beach position which makes this villa one of very limited number of properties which enjoy direct access to the beach in the area. Situated within the exclusive residential area of Los Monteros, a tranquil community located just East of Marbella and at a 7 minute drive into the town centre and 15 minutes to Puerto Banus. The area offers 24 hour security, the 5 star Los Monteros hotel and the renowned La Cabane beach club. Completed in 2011, the property has been built to the highest standards and with exquisite attention to detail. The villa has been designed and constructed to include all the features typical of a contemporary luxury home. The expansive split-level living room leads off the entrance hall into to the formal dining room beyond. This area of the house is a superb entertaining area since, besides the generous scale of the living and dining rooms, both lead on to a spacious covered terrace with external fireplace which offers stunning views of the sea.  The large family kitchen has been fully fitted with Silestone work surfaces and equipped with Bosch Appliances and features a central island. A laundry room and staff bedroom with bathroom with independent access complete this wing of the property. Additionally on the ground floor are three bedroom suites – one of which is connected to the main south facing terrace. The interior gardens ensure this cleverly designed home is flooded with daylight in all areas. The infinity pool with its own cascade is lit beautifully during the evening and has its own chill-out area ideal for a sunset cocktail.

A beautiful and well maintained garden is the frame of one of the best sited villas in La Zagaleta estate. No doubt the owners who built the house in 2001 must have done a thorough search to find this plot which offers fabulous views of the sea and hills around. The villa is perfect for a couple with guests or visiting family. The guest bedrooms are in a private wing on the ground floor and also in the basement which because of the slope of the plot has direct access to the gardens whilst the master suite occupies the upper floor and has a large open private terrace. When the couple is alone in the house, the guests' wings can be easily closed off and they use their master suite upstairs and the reception rooms on the ground floor so they house is more intimate and manageable.  The large covered terraces on the ground floor has folding glass doors thus making it posible to use them during the whole year. It's a delight to sit here on a winter day to enjoy the views over the garden and swimming pool and bask in the sun.

This is undoubtedly the true idea of a personal paradise in Marbella! From the moment our team stepped through the door we appreciated the thought and attention to detail which the owner has given to this property by creating so many enchanting spaces that exude style and refinement. Very rarely does one feel right “at home” when visiting a property, but this property did exactly that to us! With its lovely fireplace in the entrance hall or lovely kitchen in which one can imagine hanging out with friends and family, the property offers a very homely atmosphere.

Villa in Altos de los Monteros","La Finca de Marbella finds itself ensconced on the western side of Rio Real, just east of Marbella town in a peaceful residential area dominated by gentle olive and pine-clad slopes, beaches, dunes and sea views. This location has the distinction of being highly central and peaceful, thus endowing the private community of villas with the best of both worlds.
The choice of modern contemporary styling may follow the latest market trends, but it is also an integral part of the vision behind the project. La Finca de Marbella is designed to combine a sleek architectural language with a tranquil natural setting surrounded by olive groves. In blending nature and modernity we wish to offer a perfect combination of both, as in the case of a location that is peaceful and secure yet also central and convenient.
Modern, stylish interiors, natural light, spacious bedrooms and large terraces are at the heart of the La Finca concept. There are a variety of kitchen layouts available which allow you to personalise your living area.
La Finca de Marbella is more than just an idea. The concept is the result of years of accumulated experience in the real estate market; the highs, the lows, the trends.
It bridges the gap between apartments and townhouses on the one hand and Marbella’s opulent villas on the other. It combines the freedom and lifestyle of a villa with the practicality and cost of a smaller property in a way not achieved before.","Air conditioning, Brand new, Central heating, Covered terrace, Dining room, Double glazing, Electric blinds, Fireplace, Fitted wardrobes, Fully fitted kitchen, Guest room, Guest toilet, Kitchen equipped, Laundry room, Living room, Marble floors, Mountain view, Mountainside, Panoramic view, Private terrace, Sea view",36.5297,-4.83625,"1,312,541,131,254,210,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000"
